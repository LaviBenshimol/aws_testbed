Deploying a serverless web application on AWS using a provided GitHub repository involves several steps. Here is a high-level outline of the process:

Preparation:

Ensure that you have the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) installed and configured on your machine.
Have your AWS credentials (access key ID and secret access key) ready.
Install necessary software like Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Set Up the AWS Resources:

Use AWS CloudFormation to create the necessary AWS resources as defined in the repository's CloudFormation template.
Deploy the Application:

Deploy the web application using AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.
Access the Application:

Access the deployed web application through its URL.
Now, let’s delve into the detailed steps:

Step 1: Preparation
Install AWS CLI:

Download and install the AWS CLI from AWS CLI website.
Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials by running aws configure in your terminal and following the prompts.
Install Node.js and npm:

Download and install Node.js from Node.js website.
npm is included with Node.js, so you don’t need to install it separately.
Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the Repository:
Open PyCharm, navigate to VCS -> Get from Version Control.
Enter the URL of the repository https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-refarch-webapp and click on Clone.
Step 3: Set Up the AWS Resources
Create AWS Resources:
Navigate to the cloned repository folder in your terminal.
Run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Run the command npm run create-resources to create the AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation. This will use the aws cloudformation create-stack command to create a new CloudFormation stack with the necessary resources.
Step 4: Deploy the Application
Deploy the Application:
In the same terminal, run the command npm run deploy to deploy the web application to AWS.
Step 5: Access the Application
Access the Application:
Once the deployment is complete, you can access the web application through the URL provided in the output.
You may also find the URL in the AWS CloudFormation console in the Outputs tab of your stack.
Ensure you follow the steps in the given order to successfully deploy the serverless web application on AWS.
